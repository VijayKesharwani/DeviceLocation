## Discussion

| Agenda Item | Description | Discussion & Action Points |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Alignment with guidelines | [Issue #15](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/15), related to [Issue #12](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/12). We must adapt errors and properties to guidelines<br> - Waiting for new model for `ueId`/`device` to be consolidated in  [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand) WG. Expected for next weeks | - QoD finally [merged changes, renaming `ueId` to `device`](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/qod-api.yaml)<br> - Apply those same changes to DeviceLocation?  |
| Subscription for Location Area | [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #49](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/49)<br> - Some feedback by Orange and Telefónica<br> - Some pending comments: Add DELETE and GET, support for subscription termination due to consent removal (new event?)<br> - New PR proposed to `main` branch by @maxl2287 (DT), as previous one [#27](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/27) was closed | - Some agreement reached in [Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/156)<br> - @Ludovic: hope to be able to make a proposal once validated by commonalities to device location. Take AP? |
| Add `maxAge` | [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34)<br> - Feedback from Telefónica<br> - LastLocationTime makes sense for B2B UB but team agreed that privacy constraint need to be considered <br> - Also proposed as [Issue #42](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/42), so closed as duplicated <br> - Wait for clear requirement to complete model | - Pending AP: **Call for uses cases from the team, in particular for fresh information** (Need to figure out how it should work (DT) - Discussion also in Telefonica group)|
| Postal Code Area | [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)<br> - Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area<br> - Discussion on the model, as other code could be used (like INSEE code in France)<br> - Model could accommodate to have several type of code, but our polymorphic model also allow us to be precise.<br> - No additional requirement from Orange on INSEE code used in France | <br> - **New PR proposed by Telefonica.** OK from Ludovic (Orange), Akos will take a look for DT.<br> - Merge?? |
| Provide location | [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [Commonalities Issue #178](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/178)<br> - Also new [Issue #43](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/43) may be related<br> - Proposal by Ericsson, feedback by DT and TEF <br> - The use case is interesting. Get more details from Product teams<br> - We agree that is a specific endpoint - discussion about adding it to the current API or have a separate API. Version management should be taken into account. Raised an issue in Commonalities about "multiple endpoint API" vs "multiple API - Feedback from TEF and DT | <br><br> - TEF in favour of splitting, DT in favour of keeping one single API for now, Orange, others??|
