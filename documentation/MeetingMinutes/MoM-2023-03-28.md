We must adapt errors and properties to guidelines<br> - Waiting for new model for `ueId`/`device` to be consolidated in  [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand) WG. Expected for next weeks | - Keep waiting until proposal is merged in  QoD? |

| Add `maxAge` | [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34)<br> - Feedback from Telefónica<br> - LastLocationTime makes sense for B2B UB but team agreed that privacy constraint need to be considered <br> - Also proposed as [Issue #42](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/42), so closed as duplicated | - Any feedback? Keep discussion open? |
| Postal Code Area | [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39)<br> - Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area<br> - No feedback so far |  - Any comments? TEF to propose PR?  |
| Provide location | [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40)<br> - Also new [Issue #43](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/43) may be related<br> - Proposal by Ericsson, feedback by DT and TEF | - A new endpoint in same API, or a different API? Should we consider any relation with Device Status?<br> - How is location provided? Point, Circle...?<br> - Clarify relation with [Issue #43](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/43) |


## AOB

* In last meeting, DT mentioned to be currently working on an implementation against the NEF
  - To add implemenation code, we may need a new subproject per provider implementaion (PI)as QoD does.
  - **Any update?**
<p/>

* In last meeting, Rafal raised the point about release management:
  - 0.1 was released for MWC
  - Right now we working on 0.2
  - We need to have an agreement around all API.

 <p/>
