### New API to provide raw location, v0.1-wip

  - Reviewed, has 2 approvals. Ready to be merged
  - Ludovic will work on the documentation only once PR#55 has been merged to avoid 


### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 

* New [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85)
  - TEF provided a doc with a proposal and use cases for the implementation of 'Partial' and matchRate
  - To discuss during meeting

### Roadmap for Release v0.2

* New [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85) to unify naming for POST operations
  - Current one: POST /verifications + POST /retrieve-location
  - Decide on POST /verify-location + POST /retrieve-location, or simpler: POST /verify + POST /retrieve

* We have to decide in Commonalities how to communicate roadmap for multiple API project.

* Our roadmap could be: 
  - Release in July featuring 
    - For check location: -> ready for 0.2
      - ~~Rename location to location-verification (issue 59)~~
      - ~~Align device model (PR 61)~~
      - ~~Add documentation in the OAS~~
    - For raw location: 
      - Provide v0.1 -> ready to be merged - documentation will be tackled in a separate PR
      - With documentation integrated in the OAS -> Pending PR
  - Release in August / September (depending on holidays):  
    - Adding location subscription/notification for checking location

* From roadmap perspective we are on track for API definition - for the documentation it could be probably delivered in July. 


### Postal Code Area

* New [Issue #83](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/83), with formal requirements from GSMA Product track, closing old [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39). [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47) to be closed when new one is created.

* Some initial comments, we can start discussion but this requirement will be in the scope of future releases.
  - How to handle the 'diversity' of the 'geo' code that we can have in a given country.
  - How to discover what is implemented by each provider.
  - Error scenario must be defined in CAMARA if the area type requested is not supported by the telco
