## Open issues and PRs


### Subscription for Location Area 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #49](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/49)
  - PR #49 should be close, new PR to be created
  - **DT will continue the crafting work**
 
* [Issue #69](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/69): Proposal for new name
  - Orange preference for `location-verification-subscription`
  - Any other opinions?


### New API to provide raw location

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)

* Review PR by Ludovic:
  - Switched to meters
  - Added `maxAge` (optional) to request
  - Added `lastLocationTime` (required) to response
  - Documentation will be handled in a second PR for raw location


### Add new parameter `maxAge` 

* [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34), [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53)

* Agreed:
  - `lastLocationTime` in the response mandatory
  - `maxAge` will be optional in the request
  - Add explicit information of maxAge about the fact that its concerns only the last location
  - `maxAge` will be in second with a minimum of 60.

* Comments in [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53). It must be rebased, or close this and new PR 
* Applied to [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)


### Consolidate documentation into spec

* Adopt [decision in Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/164) about keeping API documentation as part of the spec

* New [PR #71](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/71)


### Units for radius
 
* [Issue #60](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/60)
  - Decided to move to meters.
  - Pending new PR
  - Decide on new limits. Now, they are 2km to 200 km


### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 
  - No new comments
  - From previous meeting: We need to provide a hint that the precision request is (definitely) too fine for API provider, need to check how current system manage when the accuracy is to small - always False?

* To be discussed during meeting


### Align Area to new model for inheritance vs polymorphism

* [Issue #72](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/72)


### Roadmap for Release v0.2

* We have to decide in Commonalities how to communicate roadmap for multiple API project.
* Our roadmap could be: 
  - Release in June featuring 
    - For check location: 
      - ~~Rename location to location-verification (issue 59)~~
      - ~~Align device model (PR 61)~~
      - Add documentation in the OAS ->  PR to be merged
    - For raw location: 
      - Provide v0.1 -> PR to be merged
      - With documentation integrated in the OAS -> Pending PR
  - Release in August 
    - Adding location subscription/notification for checking location

* From roadmap perspective we are on track for API definition - for the documentation it could be probably delivered in July. 


### Postal Code Area

* [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)

* Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area, lack of support from other partners about the business case

* TEF has moved discussion to business track in GSMA. Any update?
  - Not yet, @Jorge provides update on business track.
