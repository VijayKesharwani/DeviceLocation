## Open issues and PRs

### Alignment with guidelines

* [PR #61](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/61) merged.


### Subscription for Location Area 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #49](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/49)
  - To be aligned with Commonalities
  - **DT will continue the crafting work** -> PR not uopdated
 
* [Issue #64](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/64): Discussion if Geo fence should be separated from check location operation as distinct model/business case could be provided. 
  - Orange prefer to add this subscription endpoint in existing 'location verification' API
  - DT prefer to create a whole new API for that.
  - Other opinions, can we agree at the meeting?

### New API to provide raw location

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)
  
* Agreed to have a separate API from the current one
  - [Issue #59](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/59), [PR #66](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/66)
  - `device-location-verification` or `location-verification` ?

* Review PR by Ludovic
  - Agreed to model it as POST
  - Some comments to align naming of basePaths and scopes between both APIS

* **Merge planned June 7th EOB if no blocking comment.** -> Pending

### Add new parameter `maxAge` 

* [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34), [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53)

* Some comments on the issue, no comments on PR

* **@all, please provide comments to PR**
  - Need additional work to be completed as it is not 100% clear
  - To discuss durinhg meeting


### Consolidate documentation into spec

* Adopt [decision in Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/164) about keeping API documentation as part of the spec

* **@JosÃ© will make it but after subscription is closed (and implemented)** -> Pending
* **@Ludovic will make for the 'raw' location API** -> Pending

### Units for radius
 
* [Issue #60](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/60)
  - Discuss during meeting:	Depending on the back end - glmc (meter accuracy) or nef - the accuracy is very different

* **Ask for team to provide comments in issue** -> to discuss during meeting

### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 
  - No comments so far
  - Discuss during meeting: We need to provide a hint that the precision request is (definitely) too fine for API provider

* **Ask for team to provide comments in issue** -> To discuss during meeting

### Roadmap for Release v0.2

* We have to decide in Commonalities how to communicate roadmap for multiple API project.
* Our roadmap could be: 
  - Release in June featuring 
    - For check location: 
      - Rename location to location-verification (issue 59) -> PR
      - ~~Align device model (PR 61)~~
      - Add documentation in the OAS -> Pending PR
    - For raw location: 
      - Provide v0.1
      - With documentation integrated in the OAS
  - Release in August 
    - Adding location subscription/notification for checking location

### Postal Code Area

* [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)

* Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area, lack of support from other partners about the business case

* TEF has moved discussion to business track in GSMA. Any update?
