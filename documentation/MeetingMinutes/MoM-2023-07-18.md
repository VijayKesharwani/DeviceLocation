## Open issues and PRs


### Subscription for Location Area 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #74](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/74)
  - Old PR #49 was close, new PR created
  - Many comments, most resolved. Ongoing discussions in Commonalities may affect this PR.
  - Discuss state and next steps
 
* [Issue #69](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/69): Proposal for new name
  - Orange preference for `location-verification-subscription`, Ericsson preference for `geofencing`
  - Keep open to get more opinions


### New API to provide raw location

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)
  - Most comments resolved
  - Decide on next steps, should we wait for Release v0.2 so this new API does not appear in the branch?


### Add new parameter `maxAge` 

* [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34), [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53)

* Agreed:
  - `lastLocationTime` in the response mandatory
  - `maxAge` will be optional in the request
  - Add explicit information of maxAge about the fact that its concerns only the last location
  - `maxAge` will be in second with a minimum of 60.

* Comments in [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53). It must be rebased, or close this and new PR
  - ** @DT will discuss with the team how to process (rebase or new PR) ** -> Pending
* Applied to [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)


### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 
  - No new comments
  - From previous meeting: We need to provide a hint that the precision request is (definitely) too fine for API provider, need to check how current system manage when the accuracy is to small - always False?

* To be discussed during meeting.
  - ** @TEF will provide examples about 'Partial' UC ** -> Some internal discussions, but proposal still pending
  - We need to align on the formula to calculate the 'matchRate' for PARTIAL answer


### Roadmap for Release v0.2

* We have to decide in Commonalities how to communicate roadmap for multiple API project.
* Our roadmap could be: 
  - Release in July featuring 
    - For check location: 
      - ~~Rename location to location-verification (issue 59)~~
      - ~~Align device model (PR 61)~~
      - ~~Add documentation in the OAS~~
    - For raw location: 
      - Provide v0.1 -> PR to be merged
      - With documentation integrated in the OAS -> Pending PR
  - Release in August / September (depending on holidays):  
    - Adding location subscription/notification for checking location

* From roadmap perspective we are on track for API definition - for the documentation it could be probably delivered in July. 


### Postal Code Area

* [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)

* Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area, lack of support from other partners about the business case

* New request from GSMA to add administrative code (like postal code)
  - How we will manage case where implementation did not provide all location type?, Discovery?, Error?

* **@TEF: add a new issue and close this one.** -> Pending
 

## Test Cases

* New [Issue #80](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/80)
  - Discuss how to manage test cases for Device Location

## Accuracy Levels for Device Location APIs

* New [Issue #78](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/78)
  - Discuss if we need this functionality

## Summer 2023 presence

* New [PR #75](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/75)
  - Only Ludovic added this presence

**Next call is on August 1st**
