| Alignment with guidelines | [Issue #15](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/15), related to [Issue #12](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/12). We must adapt errors and properties to guidelines<br> - Waiting for new model for `ueId`/`device` to be consolidated in  [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand) WG. Expected for next weeks | - **Keep waiting until proposal is merged in QoD** (no progress in the last 2 weeeks) |
| Subscription for Location Area | [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #27](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/27)<br> - Some feedback by Orange and Telefónica<br> - Some pending comments: Add DELETE and GET, support for susbcription termination due to consent removal (new event?)<br> - Good progress in Commonalities<br> - Not far from the work done in Device location | - **Wait for outcome in Commonalities** (any update from Commonalities?) |
| Add `maxAge` | [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34)<br> - Feedback from Telefónica<br> - LastLocationTime makes sense for B2B UB but team agreed that privacy constraint need to be considered <br> - Also proposed as [Issue #42](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/42), so closed as duplicated <br> - Wait for clear requirement to complete model | - **Call for uses cases from the team, in particular for fresh information** (no feedback so far, any update?)|
| Postal Code Area | [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)<br> - Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area<br> - Discussion on the model, as other code could be used (like INSEE code in France)<br> - Model could accommodate to have several type of code, but our polymorphic model also allow us to be precise. <br> - Document that Circle is always supported |  - **Orange will provide information for France based on INSEE code** (any update?) <br> - New PR proposed. Waiting for review |
| Provide location | [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [Commonalities Issue #178](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/178)<br> - Also new [Issue #43](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/43) may be related<br> - Proposal by Ericsson, feedback by DT and TEF <br> - The use case is interesting. Get more details from Product teams<br> - We agree that is a specific endpoint - discussion about adding it to the current API or have a separate API. Version management should be taken into account. Raised an issue in Commonalities about "multiple endpoint API" vs "multiple API - Feedback from TEF | <br><br> - Wait for more feedback from Commonalities, and uses cases from Product teams |
